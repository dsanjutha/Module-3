# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 12)
contains_n = 'n' in x
contains_8 = 8 in x
print(f"Does the tuple contain 'n'? {contains_n}")
print(f"Does the tuple contain 8? {contains_8}")
```
